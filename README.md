# halcyon
InWorldz Halcyon 3D virtual world simulator.

Halcyon was originally based on the OpenSimulator project but was forked in 2010 to provide a stable platform for everyday use under high load. We have concentrated on performance and stability to provide a strong, stable base for the InWorldz grid - and now your grid too!

## Tested operating systems
At this time, only the following 64 bit operating systems are being tested against:

* Microsoft Windows 7
* Microsoft Windows 8/8.1
* Microsoft Windows 10
* Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2
* Microsoft Windows Server 2012/ 2012 R2

Open source contributions are very welcome - especially in regard to testing on other operating systems. We are actively working to get the code to run with physics enabled on Linux, and are seeking to assist in the development of a PhysX wrapper that works well with 64 bit Linux distros.
